# Space Defender

> This demo had been written for The Last Mile's Code 7370 computer coding
> class. It is intended to show students the capabilities and ease of use of
> jQuery. Student's will be expected to start with a nearly empty app.js file
> that contains only some partial code snippets along with a few hints. The
> index.html file should require no changes. Students are provided with all 
> the assets that they will need to complete the exercise. A student will only
> need to write JavaScript and most importantly jQuery to implement the
> full functionality this exercise.
